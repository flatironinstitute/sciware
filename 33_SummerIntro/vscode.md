## What is an IDE?

### Integrated Development Environment
#### (or just "editor")

- an interactive environment (tool or program)
- for developing (writing, editing) code
- that integrates other features
- designed to make it easier to write code all in one place


## Text editor

- Most IDEs are, at the core, a text editor
- Fancy "spell checker" (variables, functions, syntax), autocomplete
- Aware of code structure, projects, programming language, libraries
- Integrated tools for running, compiling, testing, debugging, checking, documenting, sharing, ...


## Lots of good options

- VS Code ("Visual Studio Code"): open-source cross-platform editor from Microsoft
- Sublime Text, Atom: lightweight editors with code-aware features
- PyCharm, Spyder: Python-specific IDEs with focus on debugging
