## Rules of Engagement

### Goal:

Activities where participants all actively work to foster an environment which encourages participation across experience levels, coding language fluency, *technology choices*\*, and scientific disciplines.

<small>\*though sometimes we try to expand your options</small>


## Rules of Engagement

- Avoid discussions between a few people on a narrow topic
- Provide time for people who haven't spoken to speak/ask questions
- Provide time for experts to share wisdom and discuss
- Work together to make discussions accessible to novices

<small>
(These will always be a work in progress and will be updated, clarified, or expanded as needed.)
