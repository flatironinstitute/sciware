## Sciware goal

Activities where participants all actively work to foster an environment which encourages participation across experience levels, coding language fluency, *technology choices*\*, and scientific disciplines.

<small>\*though sometimes we try to expand your options</small>


## Summer Intros

- May 31 2-4: command line & cluster
- Jun 7 2-4 in 162-2 IDA: git & GitHub, Part I
- Jun 14 2-4 in 162-2 IDA: git & GitHub, Part II
- today **1-3** in 162-2 IDA: VS Code


## Today's agenda

- What is VS Code?
- Installing VS Code
- Examples and demos of features
- Practice using VS Code with a Python project

<!-- Features:
- Built-in terminal, with exit code coloring
- File browser
- Editor tabs/peeking
- Search
- Git awareness
- Extensions: Python, Jupyter
- Workspaces
- Python
  - Syntax highlighting
  - Tab complete
  - Hover for doc
  - Jump to definition
  - Linting (yellow squiggles)
  - Notebooks
 -->

<!-- Questions
- Do we want any slides?
- Integrate short exercises, or lecturing followed by longer exercise?
- Are we going to help students install VS Code and Python? (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)
-->

# What is an IDE?

### Integrated Development Environment
#### (or just "editor")

- an interactive environment (tool or program)
- for developing (writing, editing) code
- that integrates other features
- designed to make it easier to write code all in one place

## Text editor

- Most IDEs are, at the core, a text editor
- Fancy "spell checker" (variables, functions, syntax), autocomplete
- Aware of code structure, projects, programming language, libraries
- Integrated tools for running, compiling, testing, debugging, checking, documenting, sharing, ...

### Lots of good options

- VS Code ("Visual Studio Code"): open-source cross-platform editor from Microsoft
- Sublime Text, Atom: lightweight text editors
- PyCharm, Spyder: Python-specific IDEs with focus on debugging
