## Sciware goal

Activities where participants all actively work to foster an environment which encourages participation across experience levels, coding language fluency, *technology choices*\*, and scientific disciplines.

<small>\*though sometimes we try to expand your options</small>


## Summer Intros

- May 31 2-4: command line & cluster
- Jun 7 2-4 in 162-2 IDA: git & GitHub, Part I
- Jun 14 2-4 in 162-2 IDA: git & GitHub, Part II
- today **1-3** in 162-2 IDA: VS Code


## Today's agenda

- What is VS Code?
  - Orientation to the interface
- Installing VS Code
  - [Windows] Install WSL
  - Install miniconda
  - Install VS Code
- Set up a Python project (i.e. clone a repo)
- Examples and demos of features
  - Follow along on your laptop
- Practice using VS Code with a Python project

# What is an IDE?

### Integrated Development Environment
#### (or just "editor")

- an interactive environment (tool or program)
- for developing (writing, editing) code
- that integrates other features
- designed to make it easier to write code all in one place

## Text editor

- Most IDEs are, at the core, a text editor
- Fancy "spell checker" (variables, functions, syntax), autocomplete
- Aware of code structure, projects, programming language, libraries
- Integrated tools for running, compiling, testing, debugging, checking, documenting, sharing, ...

### Lots of good options

- VS Code ("Visual Studio Code"): open-source cross-platform editor from Microsoft
- Sublime Text, Atom: lightweight editors with code-aware features
- PyCharm, Spyder: Python-specific IDEs with focus on debugging
