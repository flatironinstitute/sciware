## Rules of Engagement

### Goal:

Activities where participants all actively work to foster an environment which encourages participation across experience levels, coding language fluency, *technology choices*\*, and scientific disciplines.

<small>\*though sometimes we try to expand your options</small>


## Rules of Engagement

- Avoid discussions between a few people on a narrow topic
- Provide time for people who haven't spoken to speak/ask questions
- Provide time for experts to share wisdom and discuss
- Work together to make discussions accessible to novices

<small>
(These will always be a work in progress and will be updated, clarified, or expanded as needed.)
</small>


## Zoom Specific

- If comfortable, please keep video on so we can all see each other's faces.
- OK to break in for quick, clarifying questions.
- Use Raise Hand feature for new topics or for more in-depth questions.
- Please stay muted if not speaking. (Host may mute you.)
- We are recording. Link will be posted on #sciware Slack.
- Please keep questions for the speaker in the Zoom chat.


## Future Sessions

- Nov 4: Flatiron Clusters (for everyone who uses the cluster)
- Suggest topics and vote on options in #sciware Slack


## Today's agenda

- Demo 1: Catalog rendering
- Examples from CCA
