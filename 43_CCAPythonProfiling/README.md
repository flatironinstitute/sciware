# Python Profiling for Research Software

- December 16th
- 1:30 pm - 3:00 pm
- 5th floor classroom

Want to know why your Python code is slow? Come learn about the latest tools in Python profiling in this CCA-hosted Sciware! 

In the first half, Lehman Garrison will focus on CPU profiling, using py-spy, speedscope, and other tools. We'll cover pure Python as well as mixed Python + compiled code, and teach you how to interpret profile visualizations. 

In the second half, Philip Mocz will cover GPU profiling, focusing on xprof/tensorboard for JAX, as well as more general GPU profilers.
