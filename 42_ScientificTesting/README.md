# A Scientist-Friendly Approach to Software Testing

- November 12th
- 10:00 am - 12:00 pm
- 3rd floor classroom


Most authors of software believe they should write tests, but it isn't always obvious how to implement approaches designed for industry on research code. In this session, we'll present a scientist-friendly perspective on software tests, reframing them as "controlled experiments" on the code. 

We'll look at some examples of how to identify and test important properties of code, and will also demonstrate how prioritizing testable implementations reinforces readability.
