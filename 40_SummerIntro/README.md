# Email to interns (cc to mentors) before summer begins

1) To make sure your laptop is ready for scientific computing, please do this before the first workshop on Tuesday, June 3:

- **Macs**: Open Terminal and run the following command: `xcode-select --install`
- **Windows**: If you havenâ€™t already, please install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL): https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

2) In order to help you make the most of your summer at the Flatiron Institute, we've made a form available where you can ask computing questions and/or request computing workshops. Please let us know what you'd like to learn more about! https://forms.gle/4otCTzbXJR8qhoXs5
