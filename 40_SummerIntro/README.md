# Instructions for setting up your laptop (before the first session)

1. To make sure your laptop is ready for scientific computing, please do this before the first workshop on Tuesday, June 3:
   - **Macs**: Open Terminal and run the following command: `xcode-select --install`
   - **Windows**: If you havenâ€™t already, please install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL): https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
2. In order to help you make the most of your summer at the Flatiron Institute, we've made a form available where you can ask computing questions and/or request computing workshops. Please let us know what you'd like to learn more about! [FI Computing Ask Me Anything](https://forms.gle/4otCTzbXJR8qhoXs5)
