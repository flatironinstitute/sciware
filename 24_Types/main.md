# Applying Types

* *Not* type theory (a branch of mathematics involving propositional logic and category theory)
* algebraic data types


## Types

* If you think about types at all, you probably think storage, bits:
   * `float`, `double`, `int32`, `string`
   * `list` (of what?), `complex`, `struct`, `class`
* Types are not about how things are represented in bits, but about what those bits represent
* Thinking abstractly about your data (not the algorithm or implementation)

So what is a type?


## A type is a *set of values*

Think of a type as representing a set of possible values:

$$
\begin{align}
	\texttt{Bool} &= \\{\textsf{FALSE}, \textsf{TRUE}\\} & \left|\texttt{Bool}\right| &= 2 \\\\
	\texttt{UInt8} &= \\{0,1,\dots,255\\} & \left|\texttt{UInt8}\right| &= 2^8 \\\\
        \texttt{Int32} &= \\{-2^{31},\dots,2^{31}-1\\} & \left|\texttt{Int32}\right| &= 2^{32} \\\\
        \texttt{Int} &\approx \mathbb{Z} \\\\
        \texttt{Float} &\approx \mathbb{Q} \approx \mathbb{R}
\end{align}
$$

By saying \\( x \\) has type \\( T \\) we mean
$$ x \in T $$
\\( \left|T\right| \\) is the cardinality of \\( T \\): the number of possible values


## Special types

A couple simple types may seem silly but are quite useful:

$$
\begin{align}
	\texttt{Unit} &= \\{()\\} & \left|\texttt{Unit}\right| &= 1 \\\\
	\texttt{Void} &= \emptyset = \\{\\} & \left|\texttt{Void}\right| &= 0
\end{align}
$$

* `Unit` is the singleton type with only one possible value (`None` in python, `Nothing` in Julia, `void` in C)
* `Void` is the empty type with no possible values (never, impossible, a value that can never exist, the return value of a function that never returns)
* All types with the same cardinality are isomorphic (can trivially substitute one for another by replacing values)


## A set of values you choose

No need to limit yourself to established types!

$$
	\\{1,2,3,4\\} \qquad
	\\{\textsf{YES}, \textsf{NO}, \textsf{MAYBE}\\} \\\\
	\\{\textsf{RED}, \textsf{GREEN}, \textsf{BLUE}\\} ~ \text{(enum*)}  \\\\
	[0,1] \cap \texttt{Float} ~ (\\{x : 0 \le x \le 1\\}) \\\\
	\mathbb{P} \cap \texttt{Int} \qquad
	\mathbb{R}^+ ~ (\\{x : x \ge 0\\}) \\\\
	\texttt{Float} \setminus \\{ \textsf{NaN}, \pm\textsf{Inf} \\} \quad
	(T \setminus S = \\{ x \in T : x \notin S \\} = T - S)
$$

\*Many languages represent finite data types with labeled values as "enumerations"


## Why is this useful?

Documentation, optimization, error checking, logic!

```python
def compute(order âˆˆ {1,2,3}):
  if order == 1:
    ...
  elif order == 2:
    ...
  else: # order == 3
    ...
```

* Can be helpful for describing and thinking about code even if the types are not perfectly represented in the programming language
* Once a variable is given a type, any value it has must be in that type


## Type syntax

Different languages use a variety of syntax to represent types

| \\( x \in T \\)             | languages          |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| `x: T`, `x: int`   | Python, TypeScript |
| `x :: T`, `x::Int` | Julia, Haskell     |
| `T x`, `int x`     | C, C++, Fortran 77 |
| `T :: x`, `integer :: x` | Fortran 90   |


## Sum types (disjoint unions)

Sometimes we want to allow different types of values, so we make a new type by combining other types with a union:

$$
\begin{align}
	T + S &= T \sqcup S \\\\
	\texttt{Bool} + \texttt{UInt32} &= \\{\textsf{FALSE},\textsf{TRUE},0,1,2,\dots\\} \\\\
	\left|T + S\right| &= \left|T\right| + \left|S\right| \\\\
	\texttt{UInt8} + \texttt{UInt32} &= \\{0_8, 1_8, \dots, 255_8, 0_{32}, 1_{32}, \dots\\} \\\\
		&\ne \texttt{UInt8} \cup \texttt{UInt32}
\end{align}
$$

* Sometimes called a "tagged" union because values are tagged by which type they're from
* "discriminated", unlike a C `union`: each value is either from `T` or `S` (and you can tell)


## Type parameters, more syntax

* Types can have parameters (arguments) of other types
* \\(+\\) is an operator (function) that builds existing types into a new one: \\( T+S = \texttt{Union}(T,S) \\)
* Different languages have different syntax for these parameterized types (and different names for unions):

| \\( T + S \\)      | language          |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| `Union[T,S]`   | Python |
| `Union<T,S>` (`T\|S`)    | TypeScript |
| `Union{T,S}`  | Julia |
| `Either T S`  | Haskell |
| `variant<T, S>`    | C++ |


## Other simple types

* Adding \\( \texttt{Unit} \\) to a type is often useful

$$
	\texttt{Unit} + \texttt{T} = \\{(), \dots\\} \\\\
	\texttt{Unit} + \texttt{Bool} = \\{(), \textsf{F}, \textsf{T}\\}
$$

* Provides a "missing" option (`NULL`, `None`, `nothing`, `NA`)
* Often has a special name:
   * `Optional[T] = Union[T,None]` (Python)
   * `Maybe T` (Haskell)


## Product types

* Unions can only have one value, one type OR the other
* Products allow one value from each type (AND)
* Represents every possible combination of two types (cross product, outer product)

$$
\begin{align}
	T \times S &= \\{ (x, y) : x \in T, y \in S \\} \\\\
	\texttt{Bool} \times \texttt{UInt8} &= \\{(\textsf{F},0),(\textsf{T},0),(\textsf{F},1),(\textsf{T},1),\dots\\} \\\\
	\left|T \times S\right| &= \left|T\right|\left|S\right| \\\\
	\texttt{Float} \times \texttt{Float} &\approx \mathbb{R}^2 = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}
\end{align}
$$

* Often represented by pairs or tuples: `(T,S)`, `T*S`, `Tuple[T,S]`, `pair<T,S>`


## Larger (and smaller) tuples

$$
	\prod_{i=1}^n T_i = T_1 \times T_2 \times \cdots \times T_n = \texttt{Tuple}(T_1, T_2, \dots, T_n) \\\\
		= \\{ (x_1,\dots,x_n) : x_1 \in T_1, \dots, x_n \in T_n \\}
$$

Larger tuples with labeled fields are "structs" or "records"

$$
\begin{align}
	\texttt{Tuple}() &= ??? \\\\
	\left| \texttt{Tuple}() \right| &= \prod_{i=1}^0 \left|T_i\right| = 1 \\\\
	\texttt{Tuple}() &= \texttt{Unit} = \\{()\\}
\end{align}
$$


## Empty sum?

$$
\begin{align}
	\sum_{i=1}^n T_i &= T_1 + \cdots + T_n \\\\
	\sum_{i=1}^0 T_i &= \texttt{Void}
\end{align}
$$

* `Union{}` (Julia)

Quiz:
$$
	T + \texttt{Void} = ??? \\\\
	T \times \texttt{Unit} = ??? \\\\
	T \times \texttt{Void} = ???
$$


## Arrays = Lists

* Fixed-length arrays are equivalent to tuples:
   $$
	\texttt{Array}\_n(T) = \prod_{i=1}^n T = T^n \qquad \left|T^n\right| = \left|T\right|^n
   $$
* Variable-length arrays can be thought of in a couple (equivalent) ways:
   $$
   \begin{align}
	\texttt{Array}(T) &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty T^n = \texttt{Unit} + T + T^2 + \cdots \\\\
	\texttt{Array}(\texttt{Bool}) &= \\{(), (\mathsf{F}), (\mathsf{T}), (\mathsf{F},\mathsf{F}), (\mathsf{T},\mathsf{F}), \dots \\} \\\\
	\texttt{List}(T) &= \texttt{Unit} + (T \times \texttt{List}(T))
   \end{align}
   $$
* By restricting \( \sum_{n=a}^b \) we can represent arrays of certain lengths (non-empty, at most 10, etc.)


## Array syntax

| \\( \texttt{Array}\_{[n]}(T) \\)      | language          |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| `List[T]`   | Python |
| `Array{T}`  | Julia |
| `T[]`, `Array<T>`  | TypeScript |
| `[T]`  | Haskell |
| `list<T>`, `vector<T>` | C++ |
| `T x[n]` | C |
| `x(n)`, `DIMENSION` | Fortran |


## Real Numbers

$$
\begin{align}
	\texttt{Digit} &= \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\} \\\\
	\mathbb{N} \cong \texttt{Natural} &= \texttt{Array}(\texttt{Digit}) \qquad 85 \cong (8,5) \\\\
	\mathbb{Z} \cong \texttt{Integer} &= \texttt{Bool} \times \texttt{Natural} \quad -85 \cong (\mathsf{T},(8,5)) \\\\
	\mathbb{Q} \cong \texttt{Rational} &= \texttt{Integer} \times \texttt{Natural} \\\\
	-8.5 &= \frac{-17}{2} \cong ((\mathsf{T},(1,7)),(2))
\end{align}
$$

Strings?


## Subtypes

If one type is a subset of another, we call it a subtype:

$$
	S \subseteq T \qquad \forall x, x \in S \Rightarrow x \in T \\\\
	S \times U \subseteq T \times U \\\\
	S + U \subseteq T + U \\\\
	\texttt{Array}(S) \subseteq \texttt{Array}(T) \\\\
	T \subseteq T + U \\\\
	\texttt{Int8} \subset \texttt{Int16} \subset \texttt{Int32}
$$

* Similar to inheritance: if \\( C \\) inherits from \\( B \\), then \\( C \subset B \\)


## Functions

$$
	f(x) = x^2 \\\\
	f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \\\\
	f \in T \to R \\\\
	x \in T, \quad f(x) \in R
$$


## Function syntax

| \\( T \to R \\)      | language          |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| `Callable[[T], R]`   | Python |
| `(x: T) => R`, `Function`  | TypeScript |
| `T -> R`  | Haskell |
| `R (*)(T)` | C (function pointer) |
| `function<R(T)>`, `Callable` | C++ |
| `Function` | Julia |


## Exercise

* How would you represent the position and mass of a particle in the 3D unit box?
* What about an arbitrary number of particles?
* What's the type of a function that calculates the center of mass for these particles?


## Types in practice

```python
def f(x: T, y: S) -> R:
	z: R = python
	return z
```

```typescript
function f(x: T, y: S) => R {
	let z: R = typescript;
	return z;
}
```

```julia
function f(x::T, y::S)::R
	z::R = julia
	z
end
```

```c
R f(T x, S y) {
	R z = c;
	return z;
}
```

```haskell
f :: T -> S -> R
f x y = haskell
```


## Checking types

* Much of the advantage of types comes from checking them to make sure they hold
* This can be done in one of two ways:
   * "Statically": before the program runs, by the compiler or static analysis tool
      * Lets you catch errors (typos, bugs) before they happen
   * "Dynamically": while the program runs, as values are created or used
      * Extra checks can slow down your code
* Most languages end up using a mix of both


## Classes as types

* In many languages you can use classes to represent your own types
* If you want additional constraints on the values beyond their storage types, you can verify these in the constructor (\\( 0 \le x \le 1 \\))
* It's nice if storage representation for values is opaque (users of the class don't interact directly with the value), but this can be impractical for performance in some cases
