## Rules of Engagement

### Goal:

Activities where participants all actively work to foster an environment which encourages participation across experience levels, coding language fluency, *technology choices*\*, and scientific disciplines.

<small>\*though sometimes we try to expand your options</small>

---

## Rules of Engagement

- Avoid discussions between a few people on a narrow topic
- Provide time for people who haven't spoken to speak/ask questions
- Provide time for experts to share wisdom and discuss
- Work together to make discussions accessible to novices

<small>
(These will always be a work in progress and will be updated, clarified, or expanded as needed.)
</small>

## Center-hosted Sciware

- Sciware will rotate between centers each month
   - focus on topics of interest to centers
   - include voices from all centers
   - each center will host twice a year
   - open to all
- Suggest topics or contribute to content in #sciware Slack
- We are recording. Link will be posted to [https://sciware.flatironinstitute.org/](https://sciware.flatironinstitute.org/)

## Today's Agenda

- Intro to inter-language operability
- Julia <-> Python, Julia <-> C
- Python <-> C/C++

# Python ctypes

https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html

---

## Python ctypes
- [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html) is part of the Python standard library
- Lets you load a shared object, call functions, access variables, etc.
- Responsibility falls on the user to compile the shared object and call the functions with the correct signature
- *Very* easy to get this wrong and cause the Python interpreter to crash!

---

## Python ctypes
```c
void compute_pair_dist(const size_t nbin, size_t *dist, const size_t npart, const double *pos2d) {
    /* Compute all pair-wise distances between the points in `pos2d`
     * and store the histogram of distances in `dist`.
     */

    for (int i = 0; i < npart; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < npart; j++) {
            double dx = pos2d[i * 2] - pos2d[j * 2];
            double dy = pos2d[i * 2 + 1] - pos2d[j * 2 + 1];
            double r = sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
            int k = (int) (r*nbin);
            if (k < nbin) {
                dist[k]++;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Python ctypes
1. Compile the C code into a shared object (user is responsible for this, perhaps use a Makefile or CMake):

```console
gcc -fPIC -c -o example.o example.c
gcc -fPIC -shared -o example.so example.o
```

2. Load the shared object in Python using ctypes:

```python
import ctypes
lib = ctypes.CDLL('./example.so')
```

---

## Python ctypes
3. Set up the arguments and the return types:

```python
compute_pair_dist = lib.compute_pair_dist
# void compute_pair_dist(const size_t nbin, size_t *dist, const size_t npart, const double *pos2d)
compute_pair_dist.argtypes = [ctypes.c_size_t,
                              ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_size_t),
                              ctypes.c_size_t,
                              ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_double),
                              ]
compute_pair_dist.restype = None
```

---

## Python ctypes

4. Call the function (finally!):
```python
compute_pair_dist(nbin,
                  dist.ctypes.data_as(ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_size_t)),
                  n,
                  pos2d.ctypes.data_as(ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_double)),
                  )
```

### Live demo

---

## Python ctypes
- By default, Python knows nothing about the arguments and return types of our functions, or how to compile code into a load-able library
- Verbose and fragileâ€”relies on the user to keep Python definitions in sync with C function signatures
- Limited support for languages beyond C
- These are some of the problems that more sophisticated libraries, like pybind11 and clair, solve
- On the other hand, ctypes is built-in to the Python standard library
- Universal, in the sense that it only deals with the platform's C ABI

# pybind11

https://github.com/pybind/pybind11

---

## pybind11
- Library to create Python bindings to C++ code (and vice versa)
- Works with C++11 and newer (hence the name)
- Seamless integration with modern Python build backends
- NumPy-aware
